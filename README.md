# Shift-Coding-Challenge
This is a code of a solution that has the most impact on my entire software development career.

## What is a shift code?
* A shift code is where a message can be encoded (and decoded) easily. This is done by moving the characters forwards through the alphabet by a certain number of letters. For example, encoding "winner" would be "xjoofs" when the code is "shifted" by one.
